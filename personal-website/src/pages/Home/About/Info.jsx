            <p id="about-info-content">
                I am a senior-year student at National Dong Hwa University, specializing in Computer Science and Information Engineering, 
                with experience in front-end and back-end web development, mobile application development, and machine learning. 
                Through my work experiences in Thailand and Taiwan, I have developed strong cultural intelligence by collaborating with people from diverse backgrounds. 
                I am actively seeking an internship or full-time position in front-end, back-end, or full-stack web development, 
                where I can contribute to meaningful projects and help the company achieve its goals. In the next 2-3 years after graduation, 
                I aim to specialize in either front-end or back-end development within the tech industry, refining my skills in modern technologies and making a meaningful impact.
