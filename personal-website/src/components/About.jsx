                    As a driven and eager third-year student at National Dong Hwa University majoring in computer science and information engineering,
                    I'm actively looking for an internship that would expose me to real-world difficulties. My objective is to learn from experts. 
                    Along with having hands-on expertise with both front-end and back-end web development technologies, 
                    I have a strong understanding of core programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms. 
                    In addition, I am proficient with Python frameworks and have some expertise with mobile programming. 
                    I also have knowledge of machine learning.
