            <p id="about-info-content">
            I am a senior-year student at National Dong Hwa University, specializing in 
            Computer Science and Information Engineering, with extensive experience in 
            front-end and back-end website development, mobile application development
            , and machine learning. Additionally, I have cultivated cultural intelligence 
            from working with people from diverse backgrounds during my internship experiences 
            in Thailand and Taiwan. I am actively seeking an internship in front-end, back-end, 
            or full-stack web development positions to gain hands-on experience and learn from 
            a professional team while contributing to project completion. After my graduation 
            for 2-3 years, I hope to be working in the industry in either front-end or back-end 
            position in website development.
