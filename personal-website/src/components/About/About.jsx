                    Being an adventurer means I like exploring new places.
                    When I have free time or want to take a break from work, 
                    I usually look for a nearby location that I have never been to before to see what the area is like.  
                    This concept also applied to my vacation.

                    Along withÂ my adventurer hobby, I enjoy exploring new restaurants and cafes where I can enjoy the atmosphere and the food, 
                    and if I have the opportunity, I will return to some of the places I have visited with my friend.
